# TextFieldEffects

I fell in love with the text inputs effects in [this article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/01/08/inspiration-text-input-effects/). As an exercise I decided to recreate as many of them as I can using Swift *(some of them have a personal touch)*.

Currently it features the following effects from the article:

- [x] Kaede
- [x] Hoshi
- [x] Jiro
- [x] Isao
- [x] Minoru
- [x] Yoko
- [x] Madoka
