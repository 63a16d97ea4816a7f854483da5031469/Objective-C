# App's REST backend

**Developed by Tony (Cao Lei)**

I worked with my friend Richard to create this back-end for our apps. This project is uploaded to another Github account. This one is a copy of early project.

We used AWS(Amazon WebService) to deploy my RDS and Web Backend. Also, all the upload pictures will be store in AWS's' S3 service.

In server's side programming, Hibernate is used to open RDS session, Spring for Dependecy Injection(We have some Singleton Class, DataDao etc)
